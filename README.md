# CityPlanner

Project Structure Starting Plan:

- A command line program that reads in from several text files (maybe one larger one with specific line seperations?)
- populate lists with data from the text files
- randomly select sommething from the list depending on user input
- output it all in some form (maybe new text file? command line print out is the easist)
- main python file that handles all the executions
- smaller script/class files that deal with all the individual file reading

Parts needed for development:
- read in a file
- ask for user input
- parse read in information and populate lists with it
- output to file or cmd line
